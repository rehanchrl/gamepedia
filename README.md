> game catalog in app

this is an app for see list of game base on this [API](https://rawg.io) and if you click one of the game it will show the detail game such as platform support, genre and the description. You can add a movie to favorite by clicking the heart button and the icon will change if it already added to your favorite. you can see your list of favorite too on the favorite tab. i dont use any third party so you can run without installing them.

i have designed the lo-fi mockup [here](https://www.figma.com/file/HJCe0fESvxWv0O0pgiqHEu/Gamepedia?node-id=0%3A1) you can check the lo-fi design in design folder
